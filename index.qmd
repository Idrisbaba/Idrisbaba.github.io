## Welcome {.unnumbered}

Hello <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/"><img src="assets/casa_logo.jpg" alt="CASA0023 course" width="120" align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em"/></a> and welcome to the Term 2 module Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments.

This learning diary is part of the course taught at CASA in Term 2 MSc module, CASA00023. This website is a reflection of all the content of this module. [CASA00023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environment](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023), although these contents are only the ones I find interesting and most beneficial for my career.

## Intended course learning outcomes

By the end of this module, I will become familiar with these concepts:

-   Create a reproducible online **portfolio workbook**
-   Explain and evaluate common issues with urban and environmental policies at the local, national, and international level that fail to consider spatial data
-   Revise vague and ambiguous development targets
-   Appropriately pre-process Earth observation imagery ready for analysis
-   Apply published methodologies to extract meaning from Earth observation data
-   Combine a variety of spatial data to demonstrate the benefits of data-informed governance and planning
-   Create and design a reproducible workflow for consistent monitoring of urban and environmental metrics
-   Critique and optimize recently developed metropolitan climate mitigation strategies using appropriate spatial data, optimizing financial investment and environmental outcomes

## Acknowledgement {.unnumbered}

Thanks to **Andy**, who inspired me to build this learning diary as part of my assessment. Most of the styles and formats are adapted from his repository:

-   [Dr Andy Maclachlan](https://x.com/andymaclachlan)
-   The R package and analysis used within this book has been inspired by [Andy’s open repository](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan). I've certainly learned a lot from it!
