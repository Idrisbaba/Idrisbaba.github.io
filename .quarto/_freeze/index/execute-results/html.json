[CASA00023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environment](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023) although these contents, are only the contents I find interesting and most beneficial for my career.\n\n## Intended course learning outcomes\n\nBy the end of this module I will become familiar with these concepts:\n\n-   Create a reproducible online **portfolio workbook**\n\n-   Explain and evaluate common issues with urban and environmental policies at the local, national and international level that fail to consider spatial data\n\n-   Revise vague and ambiguous development targets\n\n-   Appropriately pre-process Earth observation imagery ready for analysis\n\n-   Apply published methodologies to extract meaning from Earth observation data\n\n-   Combine a variety of spatial data to demonstrate the benefits of data-informed governance and planning.\n\n-   Create and design a reproducible workflow for consistent monitoring of urban and environmental metrics\n\n-   Critique and optimise recently developed metropolitan climate mitigation strategies using appropriate spatial data, optimizing financial investment and environmental outcomes\n\n## Acknowledgement {.unnumbered}\n\nThanks to **Andy** who inspired me to build this learning diary as part of my assessment, most of the styles and format is gotten from his repo :\n\n-   [Dr Andy Maclachlan](https://x.com/andymaclachlan),\n\nThe R package and analysis used within this book has been inspired by [Andy](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan),\n\nI've certainly learnt a lot from his open code repository!\n",
