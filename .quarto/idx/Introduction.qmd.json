{"title":"Introduction","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n**Summary:** this week I was introduced to remote sensing and different concept of remote sensing, starting from electromagnetic spectrum, radiation, wavelength, spectral signature, sensors, data exploration, and then different applications of remote sensing, and lastly, I was introduced to different types of remotely sensed images such as Landsat and sentinel imagery.\n\n**Independent thought:** I find the spectral signature interesting because I believe this could be applied in bare soil to have a rough idea of the components of that area, more like a preliminary approach to learning something within a particular area. Like in the case of planning you can know\n\n**limitations:**\n\n**Comment:**\n\n## Application:\n\nTCT, which stands for tassle cap transformation which I find very interesting and quite related to the topics covered in this week. The paper used Tassle cap transformation methodology to monitor forest vegetation and detect changes in the forest cover from a natural park in Bulgaria. Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) methodology was applied using Sentinel-2 satellite images, resulting in three components: \"brightness,\" \"greenness,\" and \"wetness. They used the \"greenness\" component to calculate the Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI), and these provides data on forest vegetation dynamics over short and long-term periods (Andrey Stoyanov, 2022) . The study provided detailed maps showing changes in vegetation over different periods, highlighting areas of positive and negative changes. While this, which contrasts with the first paper, used Landsat 8 images to measure rice production at Al-Najaf in the middle south of Iraq, where they intended to qunatify the amount of rice being produces, and have some kind of accuracy in comparison to the information given by government of iran in force of food security. A new classification method using the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) using Landsat-8 imagery (Saleh Ali, 2016)\n\n## Reflection\n\nBy the end of week one, I found that some of the concepts introduced were familiar to me, while others were completely new. I was able to understand the distinct characteristics of Landsat and Sentinel imagery—specifically, that Sentinel images have a higher resolution of 10 meters, whereas Landsat imagery is limited to 30 meters.\n\nI also came to appreciate the benefits of the Tasseled Cap Transformation, a technique founded on the principles of greenness, wetness, and brightness. Originally developed by R.J. Kauth and G.S. Thomas in 1976 using Landsat satellite data, this method holds great potential for monitoring changes in forest cover. Furthermore, I believe this approach could be widely adopted by governments, non-governmental organizations, and policymakers to support ecosystem restoration efforts, which are crucial in addressing climate change.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["assets/style.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Introduction.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
