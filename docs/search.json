    "text": "Hi Readers, I’m Idris Baba.\nWelcome to my learning diary, where I share insights and discoveries from the “Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments” module, which is part of the Master of Urban Spatial Science program at Center for advanced Spatial analysis (CASA) at University College London, delivered by Andy Maclachlan. This journey began with my realization of the growing need of programming skills in geographical data science. To bridge this gap, I decided to embark on this master’s program, aiming to blend my GIS expertise with advanced programming skills to meet the demands of the evolving geospatial industry.\nThis module is particularly relevant to my professional career, given my background in geography from my undergraduate studies. My career has largely revolved around remotely sensed data. I started as a junior GIS specialist at a state government office, focusing on cadastral mapping. Soon after that, I took on a voluntary humanitarian role as a GIS technician, creating maps for various humanitarian purposes. My career took a significant leap when I joined the multinational highway feasibility project for the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor within West African sub-region, covering five major West African countries.\nAlthough I’m still new to the time I wrote this course, I find every bit of the topics being taught to be really interesting and highly relevant to my past experiences. The principles of earth observation are not only applicable to my professional work but also to the non-governmental organization I co-founded. Our main aim is to tackle the evolving issues of climate change, and I believe these principles I’m learning can be instrumental in providing early warning signs and solutions.\nMoreover, I realized that this course could address many of the data accessibility issues we encounter during the preliminary stage of feasibility studies in construction projects. It has the capability of enhancing the accuracy of most of the analyses we conduct, and this can also reduce the time required to produce high-quality reports. Considering the challenges of data accessibility in Nigeria, a third-world country, remote sensing approaches offer promising solutions.",

The paper used Tassle cap transformation methodology to monitor forest vegetation and detect changes in the forest cover from a natural park in Bulgaria. Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) methodology was applied using Sentinel-2 satellite images, resulting in three components: “brightness,” “greenness,” and “wetness. They used the”greenness” component to calculate the Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI), and these provides data on forest vegetation dynamics over short and long-term periods (Andrey Stoyanov, 2022) . The study provided detailed maps showing changes in vegetation over different periods, highlighting areas of positive and negative changes. While this, which contrasts with the first paper, used Landsat 8 images to measure rice production at Al-Najaf in the middle south of Iraq, where they intended to qunatify the amount of rice being produces, and have some kind of accuracy in comparison to the information given by government of iran in force of food security. A new classification method using the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) using Landsat-8 imagery (Saleh Ali, 2016)",

I was able to understand the distinct characteristics of Landsat and Sentinel imagery—specifically, that Sentinel images have a higher resolution of 10 meters, whereas Landsat imagery is limited to 30 meters.\nI also came to appreciate the benefits of the Tasseled Cap Transformation, a technique founded on the principles of greenness, wetness, and brightness. Originally developed by R.J. Kauth and G.S. Thomas in 1976 using Landsat satellite data, this method holds great potential for monitoring changes in forest cover. Furthermore, I believe this approach could be widely adopted by governments, non-governmental organizations, and policymakers to support ecosystem restoration efforts, which are crucial in addressing climate change.",

However, instead of focusing solely on learning, I found myself captivated by how Earth observation can play a vital role in helping a city like London tackle its pressing climate challenges aligning with SDG’s\nThe aim of this exploration is to identify a specific urban policy and evaluate how Earth observation technologies can support its implementation.  I chose the city of London, as my case study.\nLondon has been actively working to enhance its climate resilience, a critical approach in the face of extreme weather events like heatwaves and storms. This effort encompasses a range of initiatives addressing key urban challenges:\nknitr::include_graphics(“C:/Users/Idris/OneDrive - University College London/Pictures/Screenshots/Cooling_Action_plan.png”)\nSource: UNEP, 2021\nIndependent thought: limitations:\nComment:\nThe London Plan 2021 is a comprehensive policy framework that aims to address wide range of pertinent issues within London and these will reflects how the city of London will be shaped in the next coming years, but I’m more interested in the climate change issue policy which is termed as a Global crisis  (IPCC, 2024). The latter has been a global phenomenon, the impacts of climate are basically being experienced in all cities of the world where the year 2024 was the hottest year on record and the first with the global average temperature 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. (WMO, 2024).\nThe city of London aim to reduce achieve zero carbon by 2050, strategies to mitigate UHI where The effect on temperatures measured in the city has been termed the urban heat island (UHI). ( Philip D. Jones and David H. Lister ,2009), plan to support Urban Resilience, improve air quality, implement sustainable cooling measure, development of flood defence and reduce , reduce green house emission.  My own interest lies in seeing how can what I have learnt so far support the London policy plan, sensors deployed on satellites are able to monitor atmospheric pollution and air quality from space. ( Katherine Anderson,Barbara Ryan,William Sonntag,Argyro Kavvada &Lawrence Fried, 2017) for example Studies quantifying the magnitude of the UHI effect have been performed for hundreds of cities around the world (Oke, 1979, Arnfield, 2003, Santamouris, 2015). The method of which could be applied incorporated to the London plan is The Global Surface UHI Explorer these is an interactive web app that could be used to monitor urban heat island (UHI) intensities of practically all urban clusters on Earth. The app is built on the Google Earth Engine platform and allows users to query the UHI data of urban areas using a simple interface. The UHI dataset was created based on the simplified urban-extent (SUE) algorithm detailed in (Chakraborty and Lee, 2019).\nknitr::include_graphics(“C:/Users/Idris/OneDrive - University College London/Pictures/Screenshots/London UHI.png”)\nAbove you can where I tried to use the platform over the area of London to map remotely sensed data of London showing Realtime data of areas, these was developed a new algorithm, the simplified urban-extent (SUE) algorithm, to estimate the surface urban heat island (UHI) intensity at a global scale. We implement the SUE algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to calculate the UHI intensity for over 9500 urban clusters using over 15 years of data, making this one of the most comprehensive characterizations of the surface UHI to date. ( Chakraborty and Lee, 2019.) Through detecting this areas with high emission, UNEP urban development design policy can be incorporated to cool these areas.\nknitr::include_graphics(“C:/Users/Idris/OneDrive - University College London/Pictures/Screenshots/Policy_for_UHI”)",

Some important issues were not controlling for weather factors, lack of information on site metadata and instrumentation, lack of accounting for temporal variability during mobile surveys, inconsistency in defining both urban and rural measurement locations, and disregarding the effect of scale. But I feel these critism doesn’t hold any water as eath observation has improved from 2011 till date a lot of things has changed, and more data has been acquired, a justification to my argument is where a EO dashboard is used globally to map different cities experiencing UHI",
