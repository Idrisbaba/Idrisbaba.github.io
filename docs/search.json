    "text": "Hi Readers, I’m Idris Baba.\nWelcome to my learning diary, where I share insights and discoveries from the “Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments” module, which is part of the Master of Urban Spatial Science program at center for advanced spatial analysis (CASA) at University College London, delivered by Andy Maclachlan. This journey began with my realization of the growing need of programming skills in geographical data science. To bridge this gap, I decided to embark on this master’s program, aiming to blend my GIS expertise with advanced programming skills to meet the demands of the evolving geospatial industry.\nThis module is particularly relevant to my professional career, given my background in geography from my undergraduate studies. My career has largely revolved around remotely sensed data. I started as a junior GIS specialist at a state government office, focusing on cadastral mapping. Soon after that, I took on a voluntary humanitarian role as a GIS technician, creating maps for various humanitarian purposes. My career took a significant leap when I joined the multinational highway feasibility project for the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor within West African sub-region, covering five major West African countries.\nI personnally find every bit of the topics introduced in this module to be really interesting and highly relevant to my past experiences. The principles of earth observation are not only applicable to my professional work but also to the non-governmental organization I co-founded. Our main aim is to tackle the evolving issues of climate change, and I believe these principles I’m learning can be instrumental in providing early warning signs and solutions.\nMoreover, I realized that this course could address many of the data accessibility issues we encounter during the preliminary stage of feasibility studies in construction projects. It has the capability of enhancing the accuracy of most of the analyses we conduct, and this can also reduce the time required to produce high-quality reports. Considering the challenges of data accessibility in Nigeria, a third-world country, remote sensing approaches offer promising solutions.",

Originally developed by R.J. Kauth and G.S. Thomas in 1976 using Landsat satellite data, this method holds great potential for monitoring changes in forest cover. Furthermore, I believe this approach could be widely adopted by governments, non-governmental organizations, and policymakers to support ecosystem restoration efforts, which is crucial in addressing climate change.",

    "text": "4.1 Application:\nSummary: This week started with some evolution of remote sensing, exploring how it was discovered and showcasing the first sophisticated picture captured as a tester just two months before Landsat was launched. Some of the topics covered included different sensors, such as the whisk broom and push broom types. The evolution of Landsat from July 1972 to the present day was also discussed. However, the main focus of the day revolved around various corrections in remote sensing, including geometric, atmospheric, orthorectification or topographic, and lastly radiometric correction. Part two of the lectures was on data joining and enhancements\nI really find the correction methodology to be highly relevant. For instance, I can think of downloading remotely sensed data covered by clouds—what better way to address this issue than to apply atmospheric correction methodology? Or perhaps working with an image that I need to analyze but find it distorted, so the best solution would be to perfor geometric correction. I feel that this is one of the most crucial aspects of remote sensing; essentially, any type of analysis you wish to undertake will require some form of correction to align with your needs.\nlimitations:\nSome of the limtation of correction methodology for remotley sensed data is that EO is widely becoming accepted day by day for disater sort of intervention carrying out correction methology can result in wasting alot of time, when disater occur there is need for a swift intervention.\nComment:\nSo now I can refelect based on the comment from the lecture towards the end of the lecture so much sense now, as it stated that most of the correction activities is being handled at the backend now\nA study of an application of correction which was conducted in the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, China, aimed to determine when atmospheric correction is essential for land cover image classification and change detection using Landsat TM data to identify the best-performing correction methods. The researchers evaluated seven absolute atmospheric correction methods, Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) variations, Dense Dark Vegetation (DDV), Modified Dense Dark Vegetation (MDDV), and Parameterized (PARA)—alongside one relative correction method (Ridge Method), against uncorrected raw Landsat TM images collected between 1988 and 1996.\nThe paper emphasizes that atmospheric effects, such as scattering and absorption, significantly alter satellite signals, making atmospheric correction a fundamental preprocessing step. However, the necessity of atmospheric correction depends on specific applications, data availability, and analytical approaches.\nThe study concludes that while all tested atmospheric correction methods improved results, simpler methods like DOS or relative correction (e.g., Ridge Method) are recommended for processing large volumes of Landsat images. These approaches effectively bring multitemporal datasets to a common relative scale, making them practical when accurate surface reflectance is not the primary goal. most Importantly, the methods that enhanced classification and change detection the most did not always provide the most precise surface reflectance estimates.(Seto et al., 2000)",

    "text": "5.1 Application:\nSummary:\nThis weeks focus will be on policy application week, where Andy explored different examples of policy and their implementation. However, instead of focusing solely on learning, I found myself captivated by how Earth Observation can play a vital role in helping a city like London tackle its pressing climate challenges aligning with SDG’s\nThe aim of this exploration is to identify a specific urban policy and evaluate how Earth observation technologies can support its implementation.  I chose the city of London, as my case study.\nLondon has been actively working to enhance its climate resilience, a critical approach in the face of extreme weather events like heatwaves and storms. This effort encompasses a range of initiatives addressing key urban challenges:\nAir Quality: Poor air quality in London is a significant concern, contributing to health issues such as asthma and cardiovascular diseases. Efforts to improve air quality include monitoring pollution levels and implementing green infrastructure to filter the air.\nFlooding: Managing flood risk remains a priority for the city, particularly as heavy rainfall events become more frequent. By integrating sustainable drainage systems and strengthening flood defenses, London aims to mitigate the impact of flooding.\nUrban Heat Island Effect: The densely built-up nature of London exacerbates the urban heat island (UHI) effect, where heat becomes trapped in concrete structures, intensifying heatwaves. This poses serious risks to vulnerable populations. Strategies to combat overheating include expanding urban greenery—such as parks, green roofs, and tree canopies—to provide natural cooling solutions.\nSource: UNEP, 2021\nThe London Plan 2021 is a comprehensive policy framework that aims to address wide range of pertinent issues within London and these will reflects how the city of London will be shaped in the next coming years, but I’m more interested in the climate change issue policy which is termed as a Global crisis  (IPCC, 2024). The latter has been a global phenomenon, the impacts of climate are basically being experienced in all cities of the world where the year 2024 was the hottest year on record and the first with the global average temperature 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. (WMO, 2024).\nThe city of London aim to reduce achieve zero carbon by 2050, strategies to mitigate UHI where The effect on temperatures measured in the city has been termed the urban heat island (UHI). ( Philip D. Jones and David H. Lister ,2009), plan to support Urban Resilience, improve air quality, implement sustainable cooling measure, development of flood defence and reduce , reduce green house emission.  My own interest lies in seeing how can what I have learnt so far support the London policy plan, sensors deployed on satellites are able to monitor atmospheric pollution and air quality from space. ( Katherine Anderson,Barbara Ryan,William Sonntag,Argyro Kavvada &Lawrence Fried, 2017) for example Studies quantifying the magnitude of the UHI effect have been performed for hundreds of cities around the world (Oke, 1979,Arnfield, 2003,Santamouris, 2015). The method of which could be applied incorporated to the London plan is The Global Surface UHI Explorer these is an interactive web app that could be used to monitor urban heat island (UHI) intensities of practically all urban clusters on Earth. The app is built on the Google Earth Engine platform and allows users to query the UHI data of urban areas using a simple interface. The UHI dataset was created based on the simplified urban-extent (SUE) algorithm detailed in (Chakraborty and Lee, 2019).\nAbove you can where I tried to use the platform over the area of London to map remotely sensed data of London showing Realtime data of areas, these was developed a new algorithm, the simplified urban-extent (SUE) algorithm, to estimate the surface urban heat island (UHI) intensity at a global scale. We implement the SUE algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to calculate the UHI intensity for over 9500 urban clusters using over 15 years of data, making this one of the most comprehensive characterizations of the surface UHI to date. ( Chakraborty and Lee, 2019.) Through detecting this areas with high emission, UNEP urban development design policy can be incorporated to cool these areas.",

Some important issues were not controlling for weather factors, lack of information on site metadata and instrumentation, lack of accounting for temporal variability during mobile surveys, inconsistency in defining both urban and rural measurement locations, and disregarding the effect of scale. But I feel these critism doesn’t hold any water as eath observation has improved from 2011 till date a lot of things has changed, and more data has been acquired, a justification to my argument is where a EO dashboard is used globally to map different cities experiencing UHI",

    "text": "9.1 Application:\nSummary: this week kicked off by exploring two components, which is basically SAR Fundamentals and Practical Change detection with SAR. SAR stand for sytnthetic aperture radar\nSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a type of active data collection where an instrument sends out a pulse of energy and then records the amount of that energy reflected back after it interacts with Earth. Unlike optical imagery, which is a passive data collection technique based on emitted energy, SAR imagery is created from the reaction of an emitted pulse of energy with physical structures (like mountains, forests, and sea ice) and conditions like soil moisture. SAR has been used in a wide range of applications, including studying Antarctic icebergs, tracking the paths of oil spills into sensitive marshes, and mapping the wetlands of Alaska\nHow SAR Images the World SARs transmit microwave signals at an oblique angle and measure the backscattered (in the direction of the sensor) portion of this signal in order to analyze features on the surface. Mathematically, this (calibrated) measurement is described using the term Radar Cross Section (RCS) σ, which is defined as the ratio between the incident and received signal intensity:\nIndependent thought:\nI found the Synthetic Aperture Radar to be quite interesting, which can provide detailed information about surface of the earth, from what I understood with SAR Image is it makes use of the microwave region from the electromagnetic spectrum or wavelength, these wavelength are usually longer than infrared but, but then shorter than radio waves, these belong to the active sensors, which makes the sensors very independent having full control of its processes, I also learn that these sensors capture from oblique angle, whereby if you intend on using the image you have to go through different correction methodology, some of the benefits of SAR is that they can be able to penetrate cloud cover and collect images of the earth surface, so these is not a challenge for SAR, also it doesn’t need any light as energy to function which is for the fact that it has an active sensor..\nlimitations:\nComment:\nSAR were used for different applications, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is used in many places to help with disasters. For example, in Bangladesh, it helps monitor floods and plan evacuations. In Japan, after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, SAR was used to see the damage and plan rebuilding. In California, it helps track wildfires, even through smoke. And in Italy, SAR monitors landslide areas to give early warnings. making earthquake displacement InSAR was first applied to map the ground surface displacement caused by the 1992 Landers earthquake (Massonnet and Feigl, 1998). Using a pair of SAR images, one before the earthquake and the other after the earthquake, early research focused on mapping the co-seismic deformation with InSAR. Surface displacement data are extraordinarily useful for understanding slip distribution and rupture dynamics during earthquakes, and InSAR has made an indispensable contribution to seismology by providing earthquake location, fault geometry and rupture dynamics from the measured co-seismic deformation field. In the late 1990s, studies using InSAR to map ground surface deformation immediately after an earthquake (i.e., post-seismic deformation) yielded important clues to infer the properties of the Earth’s crust and upper mantle. Mapping ground surface deformation during volcanic eruptions Early studies used SAR data acquired before and after a volcanic eruption to image the co-eruptive deformation. Surface deformation data from InSAR can provide essential information about magma dynamics. In the late 1990s, InSAR was used to map the deformation of volcanoes during quiescent periods. InSAR-derived surface deformation patterns shed important insights into the structure, plumbing, and state of restless volcanoes, and can be the first sign of increasing levels of volcanic activity, preceding swarms of earthquakes or other precursors that signal impending intrusions or eruptions (Lu, 2007)",

For example, the U.S. upgraded its F22 aircraft to include SAR Imaging in July 2017 (source). SAR’s capability to operate unaffected by weather, clouds, or rainfall makes it highly reliable.\nDespite its advantages, some of the terminologies and concepts associated with SAR can be ambiguous. In my research, I found that its use in many scenarios remains relatively unknown.\n\n9.3.1 Challenges in Adoption\nA question I often ponder is: Why hasn’t SAR been more widely adopted, especially in disaster-prone areas like Nigeria, where frequent flooding occurs? Government and humanitarian agencies have yet to fully embrace SAR technology, even though it could significantly enhance disaster response and management.\n\n\n9.3.2 Global Frameworks and Policies\nOn the brighter side, there are international frameworks and policies focused on satellite-assisted disaster management. For instance, Space Voyage Ventures discusses this in detail (source).",

The paper used Tassle cap transformation methodology to monitor forest vegetation and detect changes in the forest cover from a natural park in Bulgaria. Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) methodology was applied using Sentinel-2 satellite images, resulting in three components: “brightness,” “greenness,” and “wetness. They used the”greenness” component to calculate the Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI), and these provides data on forest vegetation dynamics over short and long-term periods (Andrey Stoyanov, 2022) .\n figure 1 displays four maps showing the spatial distribution of the TCT–greenness component values from 2020-2021\n This figure presents four corresponding maps showing the spatial distribution of NDVI values for the exact same dates as in Figure 1",

    "text": "2.3 New Tasseled Cap Classification Technique using Landsat-8 OLI Image Bands\nWhile our previous discussion used sentinel 2 imagery to map changes in forest vegetation over time in the Natural Park “Blue Stones this in contary used Landsat-8 OLI Image Bands , the authors introduces a novel classification approach based on the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The study focuses on quantifying rice cultivation acreage in Al-Najaf and Al-Qadisiya provinces, Iraq’s key rice production regions. TCT coefficients were derived specifically for imagery acquired on September 28, 2013, deemed most suitable for identifying land surface features related to rice fields.\nThe classification method centers on analyzing scatterplots of TCT Greenness and Brightness components, dividing them into regions corresponding to reflectance values for land cover classification. This approach compresses multispectral data into fewer bands associated with physical scene characteristics, ensuring minimal information loss. Preprocessing included radiometric correction of Landsat-8 OLI images to Top of Atmospheric (TOA) reflectance, and TCT components (Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness) were calculated using weights tailored for OLI bands. (Ali and Salman (2016)\nA key aspect of the methodology was the automatic determination of the soil line and boundaries in the Brightness-Greenness scatterplot for classifying land cover types, particularly dense vegetation like rice plantations. The calculated rice acreage (89,589.402 hectares) closely matched the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture’s reported figure (90,577 hectares), achieving an accuracy of 98.91%. For the Al-Mashkhab region, predictions (9,248.22 hectares) aligned with agricultural office data (8,750 hectares), yielding a 97.86% accuracy for crop production.\nUnlike forest monitoring studies that track temporal changes, this research validated a static classification technique for mapping rice cultivation. Its findings emphasize the value of Landsat-8 OLI data and the new TCT-based method in agricultural mapping, with significant implications for food security and resource management. The results may even surpass the accuracy of official agricultural data(Ali and Salman (2016).",
